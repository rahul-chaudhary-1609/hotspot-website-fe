              We want the Hotspot App to be a safe experience for everyone involved: Rushers,

              transport of any restricted products and reserves the right to terminate any such
              orders in accordance with the Community Guidelines. Such restricted products include,

                could be limited, suspended, or even deactivated. These situations include but are
